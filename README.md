# calendar

> A calendar project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Notes

* A sample data has been preloaded into the deployment for ease of access, Data is available only for september 2019
* Internalization has been done with a simple key-pair mechanism internally without usage of 3rd party libraries
* Lots of optimizations are possible some of which i have metioned as to-do in the code
* You can comment out the 'created' lifecycle hook in App.vue in order to remove sample data
